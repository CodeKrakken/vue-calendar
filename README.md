# Vue Calendar (work in progress)
A simple day planner, built as a tech test. This is a frontend only, single page app coded in JavaScript, Vue, HTML and CSS.

## Installation and Usage
* Clone the repository
* Open `index.html` in your browser
* Populate the calendar using console command `window.renderDay([{start: a, end: b}, {start: c, end: d}])`
* Start and end times should be given as integers representing minutes after 9am (eg 60 = 10am).

## Notes
Currently it does not handle any edgecases, and display problems arise with complex event conflicts. To be concluded anon.
